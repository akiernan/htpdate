Htpdate
-------

The HTTP Time Protocol (HTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with web servers as reference time source. Htpdate will synchronize your
computer's time by extracting timestamps from HTTP headers found
in web servers responses. Htpdate can be used as a daemon, to keep your
computer synchronized.
Accuracy of htpdate is usually around 0.5 seconds (better with multiple
servers). If this is not good enough for you, try the ntpd package.

Install the htp package if you need tools for keeping your system's
time synchronized via the HTP protocol. Htpdate works also through
proxy servers.


New in 0.4
==========

- Spread the individual time polls better, to gain accuracy with
  a small number of web servers as source
- Added debug mode, so you can value the quality of the timestamps
  from web servers
- Minor correction on HEAD request (removed max-age=0)
- pid file is created
- Added htpdate init script


New in 0.3
==========

- Run htpdate as a daemon
	- automatic set/adjust time, based upon offset
	- automatic poll interval
- Added manpage
- Added RPM
- Minor bug fixes


Installation
------------

Tested on Linux only, but should work on most Unix systems.

# tar zxvf htpdate-0.3.tar.gz
or
# tar jxvf htpdate-0.3.tar.gz
# cd htpdate-0.3
# make
# make install


Usage
-----

htpdate [-adhqsxD] [-i pid file] [-m sec] [-M sec] [-t step threshold]
  [-P <proxyserver>[:port]] <host[:port]> [host[:port]]...

In general more web servers (multiple the same is allowed) will increase
accuracy.


To do
-----

- Better math to create a more accurate time
