Htpdate
-------

The HTTP Time Protocol (HTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with web servers as reference time source. Htp will synchronize
your computer's time to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) via HTTP headers
from web servers.
The htpdate package includes a program for retrieving the date
and time from remote machines via a network. Htpdate works through
proxy servers. Accuracy of htpdate will be within 0.5 seconds (better
with multiple servers). If this is not good enough for you, try the
ntpd package.

New in 0.3
==========

- Run htpdate as a daemon
	- automatic set/adjust time, based upon offset
	- automatic poll interval
- Added manpage
- Added RPM
- Minor bug fixes


Installation
------------

Tested on Linux only, but should work on most Unix systems.

# tar zxvf htpdate-0.3.tar.gz
or
# tar jxvf htpdate-0.3.tar.gz
# cd htpdate-0.3
# make
# make install


Usage
-----

htpdate [-aqsxD] [-m sec] [-M sec] [-t step threshold]
        [-P <proxyserver>[:port]] <host[:port]> [host[:port]]...

In general more web servers (multiple the same is allowed) will increase
accuracy.


History
-------

March 2004		Initial Perl version, Webtime, released on freshmeat.
August 2004		Renamed the Webtime project into HTTP Time Protocol.
				HTP started to use LWP and became mature
October 2004	Initial release of htp written in C
November 2004	Roy Keene took over the development of the C version
				and I became tester.
January 2005	A new HTP branch, this one, with less complex code and better
				accuracy IMHO :).
				Libconfig is no longer required.


To do
-----

- Better math to create a more accurate time
- Documentation, manpages etc
