Htpdate
-------

The HTTP Time Protocol (HTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with web servers as reference time source. Htpdate will synchronize your
computer's time by extracting timestamps from HTTP headers found
in web server responses. Htpdate can be used as a daemon, to keep your
computer synchronized.
The accuracy of htpdate is at least -+0.5 seconds (better with multiple
servers). If this is not good enough for you, try the ntpd package.

Install the htpdate package if you need tools for keeping your system's
time synchronized via the HTP protocol. Htpdate works also through
proxy servers.


Installation
------------

Tested on Linux and FreeBSD only, but should work for most Unix flavors.

# tar zxvf htpdate-0.x.x.tar.gz
or
# tar jxvf htpdate-0.x.x.tar.bz2
# cd htpdate-0.x.x
# make
# make install


Usage
-----

Usage: htpdate [-adhqsxD] [-i pid file] [-m sec] [-M sec] [-t set threshold]
         [-P <proxyserver>[:port]] <host[:port]> [host[:port]]...

In general more web servers (multiple the same is allowed) will increase
accuracy.

See manpage for more detail.


To do
-----

- IPv6 support (?)
- adjtimex support (?)
- I'm open for suggestions :)
