Htpdate
-------

The HTTP Time Protocol (HTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with web servers as reference time source. Htpdate will synchronize your
computer's time by extracting timestamps from HTTP headers found
in web servers responses. Htpdate can be used as a daemon, to keep your
computer synchronized.
The accuracy of htpdate is at least -+0.5 seconds (better with multiple
servers). If this is not good enough for you, try the ntpd package.

Install the htp package if you need tools for keeping your system's
time synchronized via the HTP protocol. Htpdate works also through
proxy servers.


New in 0.5
==========

- Added relevant header files, so gcc -Wall compiles without warnings.
- Added -p switch, to set the precision of htpdate. The polling rate
  is affected by this switch (high precision -> more frequent polling).


New in 0.4
==========

- Spread the individual time polls better, to gain accuracy with
  a small number of web servers as source
- Added debug mode, so you can value the quality of the timestamps
  from web servers
- Minor correction on HEAD request (removed max-age=0)
- pid file is created
- Added htpdate init script


New in 0.3
==========

- Run htpdate as a daemon
	- automatic set/adjust time, based upon offset
	- automatic poll interval
- Added manpage
- Added RPM
- Minor bug fixes


Installation
------------

Tested on Linux and FreeBSD only, but should work on most Unix systems.

# tar zxvf htpdate-0.5.tar.gz
or
# tar jxvf htpdate-0.5.tar.bz2
# cd htpdate-0.5
# make
# make install


Usage
-----

Usage: htpdate [-adhqsxD] [-i pid file] [-m sec] [-M sec] [-p precision]
  [-t set threshold] [-P <proxyserver>[:port]] <host[:port]> [host[:port]]...

In general more web servers (multiple the same is allowed) will increase
accuracy.

See manpage for more detail.


To do
-----

- Better math to create a more accurate time
