Changes in 0.7.0
----------------

- The polling mechanisme has been improved once more :)
  As of this version polls are also spread within the polling cycle.
  This way a time offset will be detected earlier, without increasing the
  polling frequency.
- Sleeptime isn't writen to syslog anymore, only time adjustments
- Previous versions of htpdate tried to close a already closed HTTP/1.0
  session.
- The rpm version doesn't override the init-script anymore


0.6.2
-----

- Bug fix, time wasn't correct if 'timeavg' was negative...


0.6.1
-----

- Code clean up, use global variable 'timezone'


0.6
---

- New poll schedule mechanisme has been introduced!
  This results in a better spreading of the polls in time to
  gain some extra accuracy.
- Removed the -p (precision) flag, because it has become obsolete with
  the new poll scheduling mechanisme.
- Extended 'debug mode' output with round trip time (rtt) information.
- Sleeptime parameters are no longer in seconds, but in 2^n seconds.


0.5
---

- Added relevant header files, so gcc -Wall compiles without warnings.
- Added -p switch, to set the precision of htpdate. The polling rate
  is affected by this switch (high precision -> more frequent polling).

0.4
---

- Spread the individual time polls better, to gain accuracy with
  a small number of web servers as source
- Added debug mode, so you can value the quality of the timestamps
  from web servers
- Minor correction on HEAD request (removed max-age=0)
- pid file is created
- Added htpdate init script


0.3
---

- Run htpdate as a daemon
	- automatic set/adjust time, based upon offset
	- automatic poll interval
- Added manpage
- Added RPM
- Minor bug fixes

0.2
---

- Htpdate can set or adjust time smoothly now, without calling external
  programs

0.1
---

- Initial release. Htpdate extracts the raw timestamp from a webserver.
